**Section 1: Background on Hungarian Algorithm and Objective:**

In this project, we focus on the problem of assigning doctors to hospitals based solely on the doctorsâ€™ preferences. Each doctor ranks all hospitals from most preferred to least preferred, while hospitals do not rank doctors. Each hospital has a fixed capacity of one doctor, and since the number of doctors equals the number of hospitals, every doctor will be matched exactly to one hospital. This transforms the task into a balanced assignment problem, where the main challenge is to find a matching that maximizes the overall satisfaction of doctors with their assigned hospitals.

To address this, we implement the Hungarian algorithm, a well-known method for optimally solving balanced assignment problems. The algorithm models doctor preferences as a cost matrix and iteratively reduces and adjusts it to find a matching that maximizes total satisfaction. This approach guarantees an optimal solution and is good to use in healthcare resource planning where maximizing stakeholder satisfaction is a priority.
